As part of my media computer science degree I did a lot of different exercises in with OpenGL in C. Due to regulations of my university I'm not allowed to publish the code, but this post will give an insight into the problems I had to solve. We were not allowed to use any external libraries except for OpenGL and GLUT, which means that all calculations were written by hand.

- Shader Programming
- Translating and animating objects in 3D space
- Generation of 3D spline maps
- Gravity simulation through Euler Integration
- Collision detection of complex shapes
- Raycasting a static scene from scratch
- Implementing BRDF and Phong Shading
